# Data Engineering & Cloud architect on GCP

## Data Engineering on Google Cloud Platform Specialization


(A set of [courses](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/gcp-data-machine-learning) by COURSERA)

This course teaches participants the following skills:

* Design and build data processing systems on Google Cloud Platform
* Leverage unstructured data using Spark and ML APIs on Cloud Dataproc
* Process batch and streaming data by implementing autoscaling data pipelines on Cloud Dataflow
* Derive business insights from extremely large datasets using Google BigQuery
* Train, evaluate and predict using machine learning models using Tensorflow and Cloud ML
* Enable instant insights from streaming data



This class is intended for experienced developers who are responsible for managing big data transformations including:

* Extracting, Loading, Transforming, cleaning, and validating data
* Designing pipelines and architectures for data processing
* Creating and maintaining machine learning and statistical models
* Querying datasets, visualizing query results and creating reports
