This course builds on the [Essential Cloud Infrastructure: Core Services](./course_3_Essential_Cloud_Infrastructure__Core_Services.md) course and enhances your study of architecting with Compute Engine.

In this course, we start by going over:

- the different options to interconnect networks to enable you to connect your infrastructure to GCP. 
- GCPâ€™s load balancing and autoscaling services, which you will get to explore directly. 
- the infrastructure automation services like **Deployment Manager** and **Terraform**, so that you can automate the deployment of GCP infrastructure services.
- The other managed services that you might want to leverage in GCP. 






## Interconnecting Networks (Module 1)

## Infrastructure Automation  (Module 3: Deployment Manager & Terraform)

= "Deployment Manager" or "Terraform" to automate the deployment of **GCP infrastructure Services**


## Managed Services  (Module 4)

Other managed services that you would like to leverage in GCP (e.g. MongoDB, Kafka, ...)
