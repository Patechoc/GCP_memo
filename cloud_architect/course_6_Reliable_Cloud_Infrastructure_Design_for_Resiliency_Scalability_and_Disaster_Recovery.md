### Application: Photo Service - Cost & Capacity

### Design Challenge #6: Dimensioning



## Deployment, Monitoring and Alerting, and Incident Response

### Learning Objectives

* Implement processes that minimize downtime, such as monitoring and alarming, unit and integration testing, production resilience testing, and incident post-mortem analysis.
* Launch a cloud service from a collection of templates.
* Configure basic black box monitoring of an application.
* Create an uptime check to recognize a loss of service.
* Establish an alerting policy to trigger incident response procedures.
* Create and configure a dashboard with dynamically update charts.
* Test the monitoring and alerting regimen by applying a load to the service.
* Test the monitoring and alerting regimen by simulating a service outage.

### Overview
