1. NO SHOWS, CANCELLATION, AND RESCHEDULE POLICY
2. RETAKE POLICY
3. EXAM TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 

## NO SHOWS, CANCELLATION, AND RESCHEDULE POLICY

* If you do not show up for your exam, your exam fee is forfeited and you will not receive a refund.
* If you cancel your exam less than 72 hours before your exam time, your exam fee is forfeited and you will not receive a refund.
* If you reschedule your exam within 72 hours of your exam time, you will be charged a rescheduling fee. This is because the test vendor will charge Google twice. The amount of the fee will vary for different exams, but is less than the full price of an exam.
* You can schedule a new date and time by logging into your Webassessor account and selecting "Register for an Exam." From Scheduled/In Progress Exams, choose the option to Reschedule/Cancel.
 

## RETAKE POLICY

If you don't pass an exam, you can take it again after 14 days. If you don't pass a second time, you must wait 60 days before you can take it a third time. If you don't pass the third time, you must wait a year before taking it again. You may attempt the exam in multiple languages, but each attempt regardless of language counts toward the total permissible attempts and the waiting period between attempts still applies. Payment is required each time you take an exam. Circumventing this retake policy by registering under a different name or any other means is a violation of the exam terms and conditions and will result in a denied or revoked certification.
