## Clean your Cloud resources

Whatever you build on GCP, it might cost a lot if you forget to delete some compute resources.

Here is a way to do it from the shell:

```shell
gcloud config list
gcloud config set project <your_project_name>
gcloud projects delete <your_project_name>
```


## Create a Virtual Machine from CloudShell

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Remove "_" from USER because "_" can not be used for instance name
export INSTANCE_NAME=datalabvm-${USER//_/}
export ZONE=us-central1-a
export MACHINE_TYPE=n1-standard-1

echo "Creating instance name=$INSTANCE_NAME in zone=$ZONE of type=$MACHINE_TYPE"
gcloud compute instances create $INSTANCE_NAME \
   --image-family=container-vm --image-project=google-containers \
   --zone $ZONE --machine-type $MACHINE_TYPE \
   --metadata "google-container-manifest=$(cat datalab.yaml)" \
   --scopes cloud-platform
```

## Check your CloudSQL instance from CloudShell

```shell
$ mysql --host=35.234.239.132 --user=root --password
MySQL [(none)]> show databases;
MySQL [(none)]> use recommendation_spark;
MySQL [recommendation_spark]> show tables;
MySQL [recommendation_spark]> DESCRIBE Accommodation;
MySQL [recommendation_spark]> SELECT id, count(*) FROM Accommodation GROUP BY id;
MySQL [recommendation_spark]> SELECT DISTINCT userId, count(*) FROM Rating GROUP BY userId;
MySQL [recommendation_spark]> SELECT count(*) FROM Rating;
MySQL [recommendation_spark]> SELECT * FROM Recommendation LIMIT 5;
MySQL [recommendation_spark]> SELECT count(*) FROM Recommendation;
MySQL [recommendation_spark]> select r.userid, r.accoid, r.prediction, a.title, a.location, a.price, a.rooms, a.rating, a.type from Recommendation as r, Accommodation as a where r.accoid = a.id and r.userid = 10;
```

## Authorizing CloudShell to access a CloudSQL instance

Assuming your CloudSQL instance is named `rentals`:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
gcloud sql instances patch rentals \
    --authorized-networks `wget -qO - http://ipecho.net/plain`/32
```

## Dataproc

### Create a firewall rule to access Dataproc tools (HDFS, Datalab, Hadoop) from your browser

This can be done before you create the cluster.

* find you IP with [http://ip4.me/](http://ip4.me/) and use it followed by `/32` in the `--source-ranges` option.
* allow TCP port on 8088 (**Hadoop**), 9870 (**HDFS**), 8080 (**Datalab**) 


```shell
gcloud compute --project=coursera-gcp-course02 firewall-rules create <name-your-default-allow-dataproc-access> \
--description="description here" \
--direction=INGRESS --priority=1000 --network=default --action=ALLOW \
--rules=tcp:8088,tcp:9870,tcp:8080 \
--source-ranges=95.130.218.4/32
```

### Creating Dataproc clusters with the CLI/CloudShell

This command creates a Dataproc cluster named **my-second-cluster** in the **us-central1-a** zone. It creates a master node with 1 CPU and a 50 GB disk and 2 worker nodes with the same resources:

```shell
gcloud dataproc clusters create my-second-cluster --zone us-central1-a \
        --master-machine-type n1-standard-1 --master-boot-disk-size 50 \
        --num-workers 2 --worker-machine-type n1-standard-1 \
        --worker-boot-disk-size 50 
```

or 

```shell
gcloud dataproc clusters create my-cluster --zone us-central1-a \
        --master-machine-type n1-standard-1 --master-boot-disk-size 50 \
        --num-workers 2 --worker-machine-type n1-standard-1 \
        --worker-boot-disk-size 50 --network=default
```


### Create a Cloud Storage bucket for your Dataproc cluster

In **Google Cloud Shell**, enter the following command to create a Cloud Storage bucket **with the same name** as your project ID **in the same region as your cluster**. Both Cloud Storage buckets and Project ID's have to be unique, so unless you are very unlucky your project ID would not have been previously used for a bucket name.

```shell
gsutil mb -c regional -l us-central1 gs://$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID
```

### Copying source code and input files to your bucket

In Google Cloud Shell, enter the commands below to copy some pre-created files into your bucket (make sure to plug in your bucket name).

```shell
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst
cd training-data-analyst/courses/unstructured
./replace_and_upload.sh <YOUR-BUCKET-NAME>
# or
# ./replace_and_upload.sh $DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID
```

### Run jobs on your cluster


#### Run a simple PySpark job from CloudShell

To run the job using the CLI, go back to the Google Cloud Shell and paste in the following command. Don't forget to replace `<YOUR-BUCKET-NAME>` with the name of your bucket.

```shell
gcloud dataproc jobs submit pyspark \
      --cluster my-cluster gs://<YOUR-BUCKET-NAME>/unstructured/lab2.py
```

#### Run a simple PySpark job from PySpark shell

Type `pyspark` at the command prompt to open the PySpark shell.

```shell

#### Run a simple PySpark job from GCloud Console GUI

**Step 1**

In the [Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), navigate to Storage and click on your bucket. It should have some files in the unstructured folder. Click on the file, `lab2-input.txt` and view its contents. This file contains a comma separated list of keys and values.

Also view the contents of the file, `lab2.py`. This is a PySpark job that organizes the input file by key and the total number for each type of pet. Notice that both the code and data are on Cloud Storage. We have not copied either of these to the cluster.

**Step 2**

Navigate to the **Dataproc** service in the Web Console.

**Step 3**

In the left-hand navigation pane select **Jobs**. Then click the **Submit job** button.

**Step 4**

At this point you should have one cluster called **my-cluster**. Make sure it is selected in the Cluster dropdown.

In the **Job type** dropdown, select **PySpark**.

In the **Main python file** text box enter the path to the PySpark file lab2.py that is in your bucket. It should be in the form shown below, but replace `<YOUR-BUCKET-NAME>` with the name of your bucket:

`gs://<YOUR-BUCKET-NAME>/unstructured/lab2.py`

**Step 5**

No other options are required, so click **Submit** button at the bottom of the form.

**Step 6**

Wait for the job to succeed and then click on the Job ID to see its details. Take a look at the job output to see the results.

**Step 7**

To run the job again click the **Clone** button and the top, then **Submit** the job a second time.


#### Pig Job that reads from HDFS

Enter the following command to copy a data file and a pig script into the folder you just created. Make sure to plug in your actual bucket name.

```shell
gsutil -m cp gs://<YOUR-BUCKET-NAME>/unstructured/pet-details.* .
```

```shell
patrick_merlot@my-cluster-m:~$ mkdir lab2
patrick_merlot@my-cluster-m:~$ cd lab2
patrick_merlot@my-cluster-m:~/lab2$ gsutil -m cp gs://coursera-gcp-course02/unstructured/pet-details.* .

```

```shell
patrick_merlot@my-cluster-m:~/lab2$ cat pet-details.pig 
rmf /GroupedByType
x1 = load '/pet-details' using PigStorage(',') as (Type:chararray,Name:chararray,Breed:chararray,Color:chararray,We
ight:int);
x2 = filter x1 by Type != 'Type';
x3 = foreach x2 generate Type, Name, Breed, Color, Weight, Weight / 2.24 as Kilos:float;
x4 = filter x3 by LOWER(Color) == 'black' or LOWER(Color) == 'white';
x5 = group x4 by Type;
store x5 into '/GroupedByType';
patrick_merlot@my-cluster-m:~/lab2$
```

let's copy the text file into HDFS:

```shell
patrick_merlot@my-cluster-m:~/lab2$ hadoop fs -mkdir /pet-details
18/05/14 13:01:04 INFO gcs.GoogleHadoopFileSystemBase: GHFS version: 1.6.5-hadoop2
patrick_merlot@my-cluster-m:~/lab2$ hadoop fs -put pet-details.txt /pet-details
18/05/14 13:01:09 INFO gcs.GoogleHadoopFileSystemBase: GHFS version: 1.6.5-hadoop2
patrick_merlot@my-cluster-m:~/lab2$
```

Go back to the Web console and the details of your master node. Find the master node's external IP address and copy it to the clipboard. Then, open a new tab in your browser, paste in the ip address and then add **:9870**. This will open the Hadoop management site. From the **Utilities** menu on the right select **Browse the file system**.

Verify that you have a folder called **pet-details** and inside it you should have a file called **pet-details.txt**.


Run the following command to run Pig:

```shell
pig < pet-details.pig
```
Click **Submit** to start the job. It will take about a minute to run. Wait until it completes.

You will get something like:

```shell

```

Go back to the tab with the Hadoop management site and again browse the file system. The output from this Pig job should be in a folder called **GroupedByType**. If you look in that folder you should see a file named **part-r-00000**.

Let's look at the output file.

First you have to get the file off the HDFS file system. Go back to your SSH session where you are connected to the master node. You should currently be in the folder **lab2**.

Make a directory below it and move into by entering the following commands, and enter the following command to get the output file from HDFS and copy it into this folder.

```shell
patrick_merlot@my-cluster-m:~/lab2$ mkdir ~/lab2/output
patrick_merlot@my-cluster-m:~/lab2$ cd ~/lab2/output
patrick_merlot@my-cluster-m:~/lab2/output$ hadoop fs -get /GroupedByType/part* .
18/05/14 13:15:35 INFO gcs.GoogleHadoopFileSystemBase: GHFS version: 1.6.5-hadoop2
patrick_merlot@my-cluster-m:~/lab2/output$ 
```

Finally, enter the following command to view the results.

```shell
patrick_merlot@my-cluster-m:~/lab2/output$ cat *
Cat     {(Cat,Joe,Mix,Black,15,6.696428571428571)}

### Authorizing Dataproc cluster to access a CloudSQL instance

Assuming that:

* your CloudSQL instance is named `rentals`
* your Dataproc cluster has:
  * name: `cluster-1`
  * located in zone: `us-east1-b`
  * nb. workers: `2`
  
```shell
#!/bin/bash

if [ "$#" -ne 3 ]; then
    echo "authorize_dataproc.sh clustername  zone  numworkers"
    echo "  e.g.  ./authorize_dataproc.sh cluster-1 us-east1-b 2"
    exit
fi

CLUSTER=$1
CLOUDSQL=rentals
ZONE=$2
NWORKERS=$3

machines="$CLUSTER-m"
for w in `seq 0 $(($NWORKERS - 1))`; do
   machines="$machines $CLUSTER-w-$w"
done
echo "Machines to authorize: $machines in $ZONE ... finding their IP addresses"

ips=""
for machine in $machines; do
    IP_ADDRESS=$(gcloud compute instances describe $machine --zone=$ZONE --format='value(networkInterfaces.accessConfigs[].natIP)' | sed "s/\[u'//g" | sed "s/'\]//g" )/32
    echo "IP address of $machine is $IP_ADDRESS"
    if [ -z  $ips ]; then
       ips=$IP_ADDRESS
    else
       ips="$ips,$IP_ADDRESS"
    fi
done

echo "Authorizing [$ips] to access cloudsql=$CLOUDSQL"
```

### Programmatically install a customized software on your Dataproc cluster

* Library of **Initialization Actions** (="installation scripts"): https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/dataproc-initialization-actions

> Note: Initialization actions are really just executables that run when a cluster is being creating. They are used to install additional software or customize your cluster as required by your programs. You can include one or more initialization actions when creating Dataproc clusters.


#### Example: Create a custom initialization action to install a Python package

**Step 1**

In your Cloud Console, open a Google Cloud Shell and enter the following command to create a Cloud Storage bucket with the same name as your project ID

```shell
gsutil mb -c regional -l us-central1 gs://$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID
```

**Step 2**

In your Cloud Shell, git clone the course repository, and upload the custom initialization script to GCS. Change the bucket name as necessary.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst
cd training-data-analyst/courses/unstructured/
```

Use [this script](./labs/replace_and_upload.sh) to rename the bucket name with yours in the lab's scripts:

```shell
bash replace_and_upload.sh <YOUR-BUCKET-NAME>
```

**Step 3**

View the custom initialization script. Change the bucket name as necessary.

```shell
gsutil cat gs://<YOUR-BUCKET-NAME>/unstructured/init-script.sh
```

What does this initialization action do on all nodes? What does it do only on the master node?



#### Example: Creating a Dataproc Cluster with an Initialization Action... from the GUI

Create a cluster that will include two initialization actions:

1. a pre-built action from Google to install Datalab, and
2. a custom initialization action to install a Python package.


https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cpb102-dataproc-with-gcp/#3

Follow the steps. To create the cluster, either click the Create button or click on the Command line link and copy the command onto your clipboard and then run it from Google Cloud Shell:

```shell
gcloud dataproc clusters create mycluster --subnet default --zone us-central1-a \
--master-machine-type n1-standard-1 --master-boot-disk-size 500 --num-workers 2 \
--worker-machine-type n1-standard-1 --worker-boot-disk-size 500 \
--scopes 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform' \
--project coursera-gcp-course02 \
--initialization-actions 'gs://dataproc-initialization-actions/datalab/datalab.sh','gs://coursera-gcp-course02/unstructured/init-script.sh'
```

Then you are going to allow access to your Dataproc cluster, but only to your machine. To do this, you will need to know your IP Address. Go to the following URL to find out what it is: http://ip4.me/

In the Cloud Console, click the menu on the left and select **Networking** from the Compute section. Click **Firewall rules** in the left-hand navigation pane. Click on the **Create Firewall Rule** button. Then, Enter the following:

* Name the rule default-allow-dataproc-access.
* Select IP ranges from the Source filter dropdown.
* In the source IP ranges text box enter your ip address followed by `/32`. So if your IP address is `1.2.3.4` then the text box would read `1.2.3.4/32`.
* For Targets, select "All instances in the network"
* For Protocols and ports, select "Specified Protocols and ports", and enter the following in the text box: `tcp:8088;tcp:9870;tcp:8080`

When your cluster is finished initializing, click on its name to go to its details page, then click on the VM Instances tab, and finally click on the master node to view its details.

Scroll down and find the master node's external IP address and copy it to your clipboard.

Open a new browser tab, paste in this IP address and then add `:8080` after the address. This opens Datalab. You will be redirected to the Datalab main screen 

You can interact with BigQuery in a [notebook]().

Now **Using PySpark in a Datalab Notebook** (https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cpb102-dataproc-with-gcp/#6)

The last notebook didn't run anything in parallel on your Dataproc cluster. This time, let's get a notebook from the GitHub repository and execute it. This notebook uses PySpark and makes use of your Spark cluster.

Use `ungit` to clone this repository https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst into your Datalab instance (Follow [these steps](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cpb102-dataproc-with-gcp/#6)). 

Back on the Datalab home page click the `Home` icon and navigate to `datalab/notebooks/training-data-analyst/courses/unstructured` [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst/tree/master/courses/unstructured) online. Click on [`PySpark-Test-Solution.ipynb`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst/blob/master/courses/unstructured/PySpark-Test-Solution.ipynb) to open that notebook.



### Delete your Dataproc cluster at once

```shell
gcloud dataproc clusters delete <my-cluster-name>
```


## Big Data and ML Fundamentals using Datalab

### Work from a given project (billing credentials)

Check that you are already authenticated and that the project is already set to your PROJECT_ID:

```shell
$ gcloud auth list
```

```shell
$ gcloud config list project
[core]
project = api-project-56998XXXXXX

Your active configuration is: [cloudshell-XXXXX]
```

If it is not, you can set it with this command:


```shell
$ gcloud config set project <PROJECT_ID>
```

### Start an instance of Cloud Datalab

Pick a zone in a geographically closeby region.

```shell
$ gcloud compute zones list
NAME                       REGION                   STATUS  NEXT_MAINTENANCE  TURNDOWN_DATE
us-east1-b                 us-east1                 UP
us-east1-c                 us-east1                 UP

Datalab will take about 5 minutes to start :sleeping:

### Open your "Jupyter" notebooks from Cloud Datalab

From CloudShell, click on the Web Preview icon on the top-left corner of the Cloud Shell ribbon. Switch to port 8081.

> Note: The connection to your Datalab instance remains open for as long as the datalab command is active. If the cloud shell used for running the datalab command is closed or interrupted, the connection to your Cloud Datalab VM will terminate.

### Checkout any git repository into Cloud Datalab

In Datalab, click on the icon for "Open ungit" in the top-right ribbon. ![Open ungit](https://run-qwiklab-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/instructions/documents/42935/original/img/fc5c4f63c40f83f.png)

In the Ungit window, select the text that reads `/content/datalab/notebooks` and remove the notebooks so that it reads `/content/datalab`, then hit enter. ![Datalab ungit](https://run-qwiklab-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/instructions/documents/42935/original/img/18f8d226fe047e84.png)

In the panel that comes up, type the following as the GitHub repository to **Clone from** (e.g. `https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst`).

Then, click on **Clone repository**.

### Get API key(s) to enable Services [optional] 

Depending on what you develop, you will need to enable Services or APIs. 

From the GCP console menu, select **APIs and services** and select **Library** as submenu.

E.g. In the search box, type **vision** to find the Google **Cloud Vision API** and click on the hyperlink and **Enable** if necessary


If you do not already have an API key, from the GCP console menu, select **APIs and services** and select **Credentials**.

Click the **Create credentials** button and select **API key**. Once created, click close. You will need this API key in the notebook later.


### Invoking ML APIs from Datalab

You can find a demo notebook under [ML APIs](./labs/lab04_BigQuery_ML_APIs).
